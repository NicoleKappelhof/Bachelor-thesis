This repository contains the code for the bachelor thesis 'Location and routing problems in computer chip manufacturing'
by Kappelhof,N., supervised by Stougie, L. and Fokkink, W.J.

The file init.py in the folder 'Main' can be executed tosolve generated instances with all four algoritms proposed in the thesis.
The parameters at the top of the file can be changed as desired.

To execute the polynomial time algorithm for C=2, the user should download the code for the Blossom V algorithm from Kolmogorov 
(Kolmogorov, V. (2009). Blossom V: a new implementation of a minimum cost perfect matching algorithm. Mathematical Programming Computation, 1(1), 43-67.).

The user should run the code with the following variables:
-g KolmogorovProblem.txt -w solution.txt -D

The program init.py notifies the user when the Blossom V algorithm should be executed. 

For any improvements to or problems with the code, the developer can be contacted at nicolekappelhof@gmail.com
